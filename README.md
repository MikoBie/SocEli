# `Sociology of Elites`: Introduction to R

This is a very basic introduction to R for participants of ''Online Summer School â€“ Studying Elites: Case Studies and Methods'' organized by Robert Zajonc Institute for Social Studies at the University of Warsaw. It was a part of the Workshop on ,,Practical and theoretical introduction to network science: history, structure \& statistical inference''.

Unless you know what you are doing just download the Notebooks you are interested in and not the whole repository. You will find them in the notebooks folder. Just save them on your local machine in the notebooks folder in your project folder. 

## Main Dependencies

* R >= 4.1.1 ([R-project](https://www.r-project.org)), however, it should work fine also on earlier versions of R.
* R packages are specified in the scripts and will install if needed, however, it is best to update them if they are not in their latest stable versions.
* RStudio >= 2021.09.0 ([RStudio](https://rstudio.com)).
* TeX Live 2019 ([the LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)), however, you might only need it if you want to change the scheme of the vector (not recommended).

## Setup

If you know what you are doing, after cloning the repo, I would advise creating a dedicated R project because it makes life much easier. Apart from that everything should work out-of-the-box.
